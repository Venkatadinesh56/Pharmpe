You should take it exactly as it is prescribed for it to be effective. Some simple lifestyle changes can help stop or reduce heartburn. Think about what foods trigger heartburn and try to avoid them; eat smaller more frequent meals; try to lose weight if you are overweight and try to find ways to relax. Do not eat within 3–4 hours of going to bed. In Treatment of Peptic ulcer disease Stomach ulcers are usually caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or Helicobacter pylori bacteria.

          "introduction": "In Treatment of Resistance Tuberculosis (TB) In multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, the causative bacteria produce an enzyme called beta-lactamase. This enzyme breaks down the antibiotics and makes them ineffective. As a result, the bacteria become resistant to the antibiotic being used for treatment. Augmentin Duo Oral Suspension comprises two active ingredients, amoxycillin and clavulanic acid. While clavulanic acid stops the enzyme from rendering amoxycillin ineffective, amoxycillin works towards killing the tuberculosis-causing bacteria. This makes the combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid an effective treatment for resistant tuberculosis. In Treatment of Bacterial infections Augmentin Duo Oral Suspension contains two different medicines, Amoxycillin and Clavulanic Acid, that work together to kill the bacteria that cause infections. Amoxycillin works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Clavulanic Acid reduces resistance and enhances the activity of Amoxycillin against bacteria. This combination medicine can be used to treat many different bacterial infections such as ear, sinus, throat, lung, urinary tract, skin, teeth, joints, and bones. It usually makes you feel better within a few days, but you should continue taking it as prescribed even when you feel better to make sure that all bacteria are killed and do not become resistant.",
          "how_to_use": "Augmentin Duo Oral Suspension is an antibiotic. It has two active agents, amoxycillin and clavulanic acid. Amoxycillin works by preventing the formation of the bacterial protective covering (cell wall) essential for the survival of the bacteria. Whereas, clavulanic acid serves a special purpose of inhibiting an enzyme (beta-lactamase) that is produced by resistant bacteria. This makes the combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid an effective line of treatment for many types of infections.",

          "Q_A": "Q. Can other medicines be given at the same time as Augmentin Duo Oral Suspension?::: Augmentin Duo Oral Suspension can sometimes interact with other medicines or substances. Tell your doctor about any other medicines your child is taking before starting Augmentin Duo Oral Suspension. Also, check with your child’s doctor before giving any medicine to your child.| Q. Can I get my child vaccinated while on treatment with Augmentin Duo Oral Suspension?::: Antibiotics usually do not interfere with the ingredients in vaccines or cause a bad reaction in a child who has just been vaccinated. However, children taking antibiotics should not get vaccinated until they recover from the illness. As soon as your child feels better, the vaccine can be given.| Q. Which lab tests may my child undergo while taking Augmentin Duo Oral Suspension on a long-term basis?::: With prolonged therapy, the doctor may monitor kidney and liver function tests periodically to keep a check on your child’s condition.| Q. Can I give a higher than the recommended dose of Augmentin Duo Oral Suspension to my child?::: No, giving a higher than the recommended dose of this medicine can increase the risks of side effects. If your child experiences increased severity of symptoms, please consult your doctor for re-evaluation.| Q. Can I stop giving Augmentin Duo Oral Suspension to my child when the symptoms are relieved?::: No, do not stop giving this medicine to your child unless the full course of the treatment is complete, even if you feel better. The symptoms may improve before the infection is completely cured. Hence, continue giving the medicine for the due course as it may still be showing beneficial effects.| Q. Can the use of Augmentin Duo Oral Suspension cause diarrhea?::: Yes, Augmentin Duo Oral Suspension may cause diarrhea. It is an antibiotic that kills harmful bacteria. In addition to that, the medicine may also affect the helpful bacteria in your child’s stomach and cause diarrhea. In case of diarrhea, encourage your child to drink plenty of water or other fluids. Talk to your doctor if diarrhea persists and you notice any signs of dehydration, like less frequency of urination with dark-colored and strong-smelling urine. Do not give any other medicine to your child without consulting a doctor.| Q. Do all viral common colds result in secondary bacterial infection?::: Most of the time, bacterial infections do not follow viral infections. In fact, giving antibiotics in viral infection can increase your child’s risk of developing side effects. So, use antibiotics only after consulting with your child’s doctor.| Q. The mucus coming out of my child’s nose is yellow-green. Is it a sign of a bacterial infection?::: Yellow or green mucus in the nose does not mean that antibiotics are needed. During a common cold, it is normal for mucus to thicken up and change from clear to yellow or green. Symptoms often last for 7-10 days.| Q. Is there any sign which shows that my child needs immediate medical attention?::: You must call your child’s doctor right away if your child experiences serious allergic reactions (breathing problems, skin rashes), gastrointestinal infections (diarrhea), and liver damage (weakness, paleness, vomiting). Though rare, these side effects are serious and need an expert’s attention."

          "introduction": "In Treatment of Resistant Tuberculosis (TB) In multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, the causative bacteria produce an enzyme called beta-lactamase. This enzyme breaks down the antibiotics and makes them ineffective. As a result, the bacteria become resistant to the antibiotic being used for treatment. Augmentin DDS Suspension comprises two active ingredients, amoxycillin and clavulanic acid. While clavulanic acid stops the enzyme from rendering amoxycillin ineffective, amoxycillin works towards killing the tuberculosis-causing bacteria. This makes the combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid an effective treatment for resistant tuberculosis. In Treatment of Bacterial infections Augmentin DDS Suspension contains two different medicines, Amoxycillin and Clavulanic Acid, that work together to kill the bacteria that cause infections. Amoxycillin works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Clavulanic Acid reduces resistance and enhances the activity of Amoxycillin against bacteria. This combination medicine can be used to treat many different bacterial infections such as ear, sinus, throat, lung, urinary tract, skin, teeth, joints, and bones. It usually makes you feel better within a few days, but you should continue taking it as prescribed even when you feel better to make sure that all bacteria are killed and do not become resistant.",

This makes the combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid an effective line of treatment for many types of infections.",

          "Q_A": "Q. What should I know about high cholesterol?::: Cholesterol is a type of fat present in your blood. Total cholesterol is determined by the total amount of LDL and HDL cholesterol in the body. LDL cholesterol is called “bad” cholesterol. Bad cholesterol can build up in the wall of your blood vessels and slow or obstruct blood flow to your heart, brain, and other organs. This can cause heart disease and stroke. HDL cholesterol is called “good” cholesterol as it prevents the bad cholesterol from building up in the blood vessels. High levels of triglycerides are also harmful to you.| Q. Can Atorva Tablet cause muscle problems or muscle injury?::: Yes, taking Atorva Tablet can cause muscle problems or muscle injury.

It alters brain activity, calms it, and provides relief from panic attacks by relaxing the nerves. Anxit 0.25mg Tablet may be taken with or without food.

If you have missed a dose, take it as soon as you remember it and finish the full course of treatment even if you feel better. This medication mustn't be stopped suddenly without talking to the doctor as it may cause nausea and anxiety. The most common side effect of this medicine is lightheadedness. It may cause dizziness and sleepiness, so do not drive or do anything that requires mental focus until you know how this medicine affects you. It may also cause weight gain or weight loss as it can vary from person to person.
